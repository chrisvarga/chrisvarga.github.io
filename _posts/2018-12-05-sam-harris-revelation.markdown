Saying that the Bible would be improved if a particular passage were removed is dubious. 

By "improved" Harris probably means something like "more agreeable to our modern ethical sensibilities." But what about the impact of a passage on history as a whole? Contrary to Harris, it is plausible that an omniscient being, who knows exactly how each person throughout history would be impacted as a result of reading certain passages in the Bible, included exactly what he wanted to be in the Bible in order to accomplish his purposes through the entire history of the world.

The Bible would be better if certain parts were removed. But an omniscient being would never give us a book that could be improved. Therefore, the Bible cannot be from an omniscient being; it is not divine revelation.

## Quote from from Interview
>The fact that you and I could improve the Bible with very little thought just take out the worst passages that have no possible redeemable content this year, or I would argue, any other year, and the Bible would already be improved. So I would argue that the fact that we can edit it to anyone's advantage is a problem for the idea that this was written by an omniscient being and not to be superseded by any human effort, now or generations from now - passages that clearly have no good application now and didn't even have a good application then. If you just think about how good a book would be if an omniscient being wrote it, it is very easy to see what would be in there that would still astonish us. It's very easy to see what would be in there that would prove, just by the time of its emergence, that this couldn't be the product of merely human minds.

## Formal Argument
The Bible can be improved.
Call a passage of a book that has no possible redeemable content a "bad passage". (Definition)
Bad passages can be removed from the Bible. (Premise)
There are bad passages in the Bible.
If there are bad passages in the Bible, then they can be removed.
So, bad passages can be removed from the Bible.
If bad passages can be removed from the Bible, then the Bible can be improved. (Premise)
If you can remove something bad from X, then X can be improved. (Premise)
Therefore, the Bible can be improved. (Modus Ponens 1b,1c)
An omniscient being would never write a book that can be improved. (Premise)
So, an omniscient being would never write the Bible. (Categorical Syllogism 1,2)
If an omniscient being would never write the Bible, then in fact an omniscient being did not write the Bible. (Premise)
Therefore, an omniscient being did not write the Bible. (Modus Ponens 3,4)
If an omniscient being did not write the Bible, then it is not divine revelation. (Premise)
Therefore, the Bible is not divine revelation. (Modus Ponens 6,7)

## Response
Saying that the Bible would be improved if a particular passage were removed is dubious. By "improved" Harris probably means something like "more agreeable to our modern ethical sensibilities." But what about the impact of a passage on history as a whole? Contrary to Harris, it is plausible that an omniscient being, who knows exactly how each person throughout history would be impacted as a result of reading certain passages in the Bible, included exactly what he wanted to be in the Bible in order to accomplish his purposes through the entire history of the world.

The upshot of this is that Christians can rejoice with confidence that the words we have in Scripture today are the very words our sovereign God wanted us to have - no matter how they reached their final form.
